Create a Project
================

Clixx.io works with a Project-Methodology. This means is that
you start off every design with a project name and directory. There
is a project for everything that you want to make or deploy.

These projects live within an IoT directory inside your documents
directory on your computer.

/IoT (All Projects)
    /hello-world
    
To create a new project, go to the command line and type:

    clixx new project hello-world for esp8266
    
This will create a project and a new directory hello-world
inside the IoT directory.
