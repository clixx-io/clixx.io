The Voltmeter board is an extremely useful board for debugging
embedded systems. It has a switch that controls it's two modes
that can measure:

 - the power line voltage
 
 - the output line voltage

This board doesn't need any programming, it simply needs to
be connected to another component and it will display the
voltage found on the line.

It's useful for seeing the exact voltage on a line. This can
be really useful in diagnosing a range of problems that might
exist while you are developing a system.
