Button Toggle Output
--------------------

This example toggles a GPIO output pin to control a motor or LED Strip
or anywhere that you wish to toggle On or Off a device.

The Button-Board generates a momentary pulse. The processor reads every
press and turns the LED Strip either On or Off at every press.
