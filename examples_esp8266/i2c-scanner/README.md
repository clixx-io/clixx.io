Scanning for I2C Devices on the ESP8266

The EPS8266 comes with the ability to handle I2C devices. This is
very handy as there are many clixx.io I2C devices that you can
readily use.

One of the first things to do with an I2C device is check that it's
connected and functioning. This is most easily done with a program
called a scanner that goes through and detects for any I2C devices
attached to the I2C bus.
