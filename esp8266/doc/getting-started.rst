Getting Started
===============

The ESP8266-01's are small IoT wifi devices with two GPIO
pins. You can link multiple devices together and add a web-server
to get access to each of the different devices that you might have:

To start off with the ESP8266, take the processor board and connect
it to the USB-Adaptor then insert that into a spare USB port on your
computer.

If you need to download a driver for Windows go to the Download-Page
and install the appropriate driver.

Depending on your platform, the following comport should be used:
Windows : COM5, Linux : /dev/ttyUSB01 etc. 

You will need to have Python 2.7 or higher installed on your machine so 
go here to python.org to get the version of python that you will need to
run the software.

Now you are ready to run the terminal-esp8266 program to start talking
to the device.
