Firmware and eLua
=================

The ESP8266 Processor boards come preloaded with NodeMCU firmware
as we've found that it's significantly easier to get projects completed
than by using the AT firmware and a seperate processor.

With the nodemcu firmware, you can easily build an entire system
on the single board system.

For complete reference:

The programming language that's used on these boards is eLua or
embedded Lua. It's a lightweight functional programming language
that enables very powerful programs to be created without too
many lines of code at all.
