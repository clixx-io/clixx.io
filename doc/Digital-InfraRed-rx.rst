InfraRed Receiver5
------------------

InfraRed remotes are found in most consumer electronics such
as Televisions, Video Recorders and Air-Conditioners. This board
is a receiver and is similar to what is found in those devices.

You can use this board to pick up signals in the same way as those
appliances do. 

There is also an InfraRed Transmitter board which can be paired with
this board allowing you to transmit and receive InfraRed signals and
control the various appliances that you may have.
