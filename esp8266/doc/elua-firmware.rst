Firmware and eLua
=================

The ESP8266 Processor boards come preloaded with NodeMCU firmware
as we've found that it's significantly easier to get projects completed
than by using the AT firmware and a seperate processor.

With the nodemcu firmware, you can easily build an entire system
on the single board system.
